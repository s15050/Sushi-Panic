# Sushi Panic

Created for the first PJATK Game Jam (topic: Japan-themed arcade game) together with Marianna Grabowska, Grzegorz Rostek and Grzegorz Ka≈Çaska.

Features: 
* angry sushi you have to pick up with chopsticks before it kills you
* local highscores table
* horrible controls (press two of the WASD keys to aim the chopsticks in the direction of one of the sushi belts; ex. W+A for upper-left)
* ever-increasing speed
